# Save Editor

This is a save editor.  It is written in TypeScript and React.

It may be a tad lossy.

## Under the hood

If you would like to know how the save files are structured, you can check out the [README of the `encryption` package](./packages/encryption/README.md).

## Development

For detailed documentation, head over to each package's README in the `packages` directory.
